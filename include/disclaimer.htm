                        <p>Ownership, possession, or license to any ILIXE product or products qualifies as “using” the product.</p>

If a condition is not met, and ILIXE GROUP does not exercise its right to terminate, ILIXE GROUP still has the expressed right to terminate the agreement, if any future conditions are not met.</p>
                        <p>If in disagreement with any of the following  terms or conditions, do not use the product. Once an ILIXE product or products are in use that qualifies as an agreement.</p>

                        <p><b>Site License</b></p>

                        <p><b>Damages</b></p>
                        <p>In no event shall ILIXE GROUP, its subsidiaries or affiliates, or their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents be liable for special, incidental, consequential, punitive, indirect, or other special damages, including but not limited to, loss of data, use, or profits, however caused, whether for breach of contract, negligence, or otherwise, and whether or not we have been advised of the possibility of any such damages.</p>
                        <p><b>Payment Types We Accept Online</b></p>
                        <p>We accept the following forms of payment for your online purchases: MasterCard, Visa, e-check, cash, check, money order and Paypal. For your online purchases, you may purchase multiple products in a single order.</p>
                        <p>We do accept online-only or virtual credit cards as long as they are issued by one of the credit card companies listed above. However, due to the requirements of these companies, these cards can only be used for website orders that are shipped. We do not accept online-only or virtual cards as a form of payment on Express Pickup orders.</p>
                        <p><b>Online Statement</b></p>
                        <p>If the customer is financing any ILIXE product or products, they agree that the Online Statement is the only statement that needs to be provided to them. ILIXE GROUP will use reasonable efforts to correct any technical failures within a reasonable time. Inability to view an online statement does not relieve any obligation on the customer’s part to make a required monthly payment or balance owing.</p>
                        <p><b>Late Charges</b></p>
                        <p>The amount due to ILIXE GROUP must be paid in full by the date such payment is requested by ILIXE GROUP. Monthly payment under a finance plan, qualifies as “must be paid in full”, and does not suggest in any way, shape or form the balance of the total amount due. Total payment is due on the date specified by the date requested by ILIXE GROUP.</p>
                        <p>You may carry forward a balance.</p>
                        <p>YOU agree to pay late charges that may be assessed by ILIXE GROUP on amounts due but not timely paid. The late charge will be no less than 1.5% per day. Increase in percentage does not require consent from the customer, and no notice is required.</p>
                        <p>ILIXE GROUP reserves the right to refer your billing account to a third party for collection in the event of default. You agree to pay all costs incurred in the enforcement of these Terms of Use and in collection of any delinquent amounts due, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.</p>
                        <p>At any time a payment is late, ILIXE GROUP reserves the express right to claim full possession of the particular product in question.</p>
                        <p>At any time a payment is late, ILIXE GROUP reserves the right to terminate the agreement in regards to the particular product in question. Accepting a prior late payment and not exercising this right, does not change ILIXE GROUP’ future right to terminate the agreement, if a future payment is late.</p>
                        <p><b>Current and Future Liability</b></p>
                        <p>The customer must agree to defend, indemnify and hold ILIXE GROUP and its suppliers harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, liability costs and expenses (including but not limited to attorneys' fees) arising from your violation of these Terms and Conditions, or any third-party's rights, (including, without limitation, infringement of any copyright, violation of any proprietary right and invasion of any privacy rights). These obligations will survive any termination of agreement between you the customer and ILIXE GROUP.</p>

                        <p>We do business throughout the United States and accordingly collect sales and use tax as required by applicable law.
